We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. **Let us ride to Camelot!** *Where'd you get the coconuts?* Where'd you get the coconuts?

## Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

Burn her! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. He hasn't got shit all over him. Bring her forward!

1. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!
2. Who's that then?
3. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.

### Burn her!

Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! I am your king. Where'd you get the coconuts? I have to push the pram a lot. Well, I got better.

* And the hat. She's a witch!
* And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.
* Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!

You don't vote for kings. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. The nose? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

Shut up! What a strange person. Now, look here, my good man. Oh, ow! Well, we did do the nose.

And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, we did do the nose. I dunno. Must be a king. I dunno. Must be a king.
